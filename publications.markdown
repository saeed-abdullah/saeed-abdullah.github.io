In the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community, top-tier conferences are highly
selective with often less than 30% acceptance rate (take a look at my [CV]({% link /files/cv.pdf %})
for acceptance rates). Papers in those conferences are considered as top research contributions with
[impact comparable to journal articles](https://doi.org/10.1145/1743546.1743569).
